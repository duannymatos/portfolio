        I first drew out the layout of the application on Photoshop according to my client’s user stories defined in our first sprint, and proceeded to develop 
        the application. During the development of the application, my client and I would have daily stand-ups do evaluate the progress of the applications and 
        decided if any changes were needed.`,
